# contextmesh

contextmesh currently implements **OA-02**, the transactional local store built
on the frozen OA-01 signed-event contract for Option A. OA-00's Rust 1.97/Turso
baseline remains intact.

## Toolchain and verification

The project pins Rust **1.97.0**, edition **2024**, rustfmt, and Clippy in
rust-toolchain.toml. Install or refresh the user-local toolchain without root:

    bash scripts/bootstrap-rust.sh
    . "$HOME/.cargo/env"

Verify the current OA-02 state from the repository root:

    cargo build --workspace --locked
    cargo fmt --all -- --check
    cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
    cargo test --workspace --locked
    bash scripts/verify-oa01.sh
    bash scripts/verify-oa02.sh

The verifiers check exact dependencies/features, locked feature graphs, OA-01
fixture stability, OA-02 schema/admission/ref tests, deferred-module boundaries,
every quality command, and the expected OA-06 failure sentinel.

## Transactional local store

Store::open creates or verifies schema v1 in a local embedded Turso database.
Every connection enables and confirms foreign-key enforcement. Writes use
explicit IMMEDIATE transactions and explicit commit or rollback.

A context is provisioned with an exact expected context.genesis event and a
sorted local author allowlist. The allowlist is append-only in Option A;
revocation and broader workspace policy are deferred. Authorization permits
local admission but proves neither truth nor relevance.

Admission re-verifies OA-01 canonical wire, author policy, and every parent.
Parents must already exist in the same context. The canonical envelope is the
authoritative stored record; denormalized columns and ordered edges are checked
against it. Event and edge rows are protected by database triggers.

Local refs move only through explicit compare-and-swap in the event-admission
transaction. Stale writers receive the current optional head and leave no event
or edge behind. Remote-tracking refs use a separate peer namespace and never
move local refs. OA-03 adds projection, merge helpers, bundles, and full-store
verification.

## Frozen signed-event v1 contract

A signed event has this logical wire form. Rendering always uses RFC 8785/JCS:

    {
      "event_id": "evt1_<43 unpadded base64url characters>",
      "body": {
        "version": 1,
        "context": "ctx1_<43>",
        "parents": [],
        "kind": "agent.request",
        "author": "ed25519_<43>",
        "payload": {}
      },
      "signature": "sig1_<86>"
    }

- EventId, ContextId, and AuthorId decode to exactly 32 bytes.
- EventSignature decodes to exactly 64 bytes.
- Text uses URL-safe base64 without padding and must decode/re-encode exactly.
- Parents are strictly increasing by canonical EventId text and unique.
- Kinds are 1-64 ASCII bytes under the frozen lowercase segment grammar.
- Unicode is preserved without normalization.
- Duplicate keys at every JSON depth, unknown envelope/body fields, BOMs, and
  trailing JSON are rejected.

### Identity and signature

Canonical body bytes are hashed with BLAKE3 derive-key mode using:

    org.aaif.contextmesh.event-id.v1

The Ed25519 signing message is:

    ASCII("org.aaif.contextmesh.signature.v1") || NUL || raw_event_id[32]

Verification recomputes the ID and uses Ed25519 strict verification. A body can
be signed only when its author equals the signing identity's public key.
Private keys are neither serializable nor exposed. Production identities use
fallible OS entropy; checked-in fixed seeds are test-only.

### Limits

| Item | v1 limit |
|---|---:|
| Raw wire JSON | 2,097,152 bytes |
| Canonical payload | 1,048,576 bytes |
| Canonical body | 1,114,112 bytes |
| Parents | 64 |
| Payload depth | 64 |
| Kind | 64 bytes |
| Integer-valued JSON number | +/-9,007,199,254,740,991 |

Larger exact integers must be strings. Public failures use non-secret typed
categories and malformed input must not panic.

## Golden vectors and dependencies

tests/fixtures/oa01-v1-golden.json records the deterministic OA-01 body,
envelope, ID, author, signing message, and signature. Changing a v1 field,
prefix, domain, limit, canonical byte, ID, or signature requires approval and
normally a new version.

OA-02 preserves exact Turso 0.7.2 with defaults disabled and adds exact Tokio
1.53.1 with normal sync and dev macros/rt/sync features. The current captured
feature graph is cargo-tree-oa02-features.txt.

## Deferred scope

- OA-03: graph operations, projections, bundles, and full-store verification.
- OA-04: authenticated HTTP anti-entropy synchronization.
- OA-05: provider recording, key custody, and real CLI commands.
- OA-06: two-node demonstration; scripts/demo.sh intentionally exits 1.
- OA-07: release evidence and Option A completion verdict.
- Option B: semantic context selection and handoff.

The placeholder binaries still exit unsuccessfully so automation cannot mistake
future OA-05 behavior for an implemented command. Option B remains blocked until
OA-07 records Option A complete with direct A1-A8 evidence.
